# WAI-ARIA (Wikipedia)

An encyclopedia article on WAI-ARIA, one of the five specification families produced by [[wai]] (already covered for [[wcag]] specifically via two earlier Wikipedia sources). Wikipedia articles are continuously edited, so `year` above reflects the access date (2026-06-24), not a fixed publication year.

## Key points

- Solves a real gap: custom JavaScript-driven controls and partial-page content updates ("rich Internet applications") have no native HTML vocabulary, so screen readers and other assistive technology can't tell what a custom widget is or how its state just changed without extra metadata.
- Adds that metadata as **roles**, **properties**, and **states**, which feed the **accessibility tree** assistive technology actually reads.
- **The Five Rules of ARIA**: prefer native HTML semantics over ARIA when possible; don't override native semantics without good reason; keep all interactive ARIA controls keyboard-usable; don't strip semantics or hide focusable elements; give every interactive element an accessible name.
- Version history confirmed directly against the raw HTML (not just an AI-summarized pass, after the lesson learned from the WCAG 65-vs-61 correction): work began 2006 (first published September 26, 2006); WAI-ARIA 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation March 20, 2014; 1.1 followed December 14, 2017; 1.2 reached Recommendation status June 6, 2023.
