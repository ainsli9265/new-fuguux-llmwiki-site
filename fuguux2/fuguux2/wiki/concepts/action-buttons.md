# Action Buttons

**Problem:** customers can't tell what is and isn't clickable on a page.

**Solution:** give an otherwise flat button a shaded, three-dimensional appearance. This works as a perceivable [[affordance]] because it borrows two sources of prior knowledge: familiarity with physical three-dimensional buttons (keyboards, remote controls), and the learned behavior, from graphical user interfaces generally, that raised-looking elements can be pressed with a mouse. Both [[ebay]] and [[amazon]] use this technique for key calls to action on their homepages (e.g., eBay's "Register Now," Amazon's "Find Gifts").

There are two implementations: **HTML buttons**, rendered by the browser with limited control over appearance, and **graphical buttons**, implemented as one or more images, which give full design control at the cost of slower downloads.

**Forces:** larger buttons are easier to see and click (per [[fitts-law]]) but consume more page space; an image-based button may warrant a redundant text link for the same destination; image-heavy buttons slow page load.

Action buttons help complete a [[process-funnel]] by giving each step of a multi-step task a clear, unambiguous call to action. This pattern is also the worked example used to introduce the six-part pattern format in [[web-design-patterns]].

Victor Ponamariov's *50 Tips to Improve User Interface* (self-published ebook, no stated license — not ingested into this wiki; see `raw/copyrighted/50_ui_tips.pdf`) adds one constraint: only one primary button should appear per form or view, since multiple competing primary buttons undermine the visual hierarchy that makes a call to action findable — see [[form-design]] for more.
