# Color Theory

The body of practical knowledge about how colors mix, contrast, and combine — distinct from *color science*, which studies color more objectively (e.g., for chemistry or color reproduction). For interface design, the useful parts are the color-wheel-based schemes for building a palette and a caution about how much weight any one color's "meaning" can actually carry.

## Color models: additive vs. subtractive vs. HSL

Screens and print mix color differently, which matters whenever a design has to survive the jump from one to the other:

- **RGB (additive)** — screens build color by combining red, green, and blue *light*; more light added moves toward white. This follows the eye's own physiology (Helmholtz's Young–Helmholtz theory: three retinal cone types, one per primary).
- **CMYK (subtractive)** — print builds color by combining cyan, magenta, and yellow *ink* (plus a separate black, "key," since CMY inks alone print a muddy near-black rather than true black) on white paper; more ink added absorbs more light and moves toward black. CMYK is economical but is structurally weak at reproducing some colors well, notably orange and some purples — a palette tuned for screens can come out visibly off in print for exactly this reason.
- **HSL (hue, saturation, lightness)** — a third model derived from RGB that maps the same screen colors to coordinates a designer can reason about more directly: hue (position on the color wheel, 0–360°), saturation (vividness, 0% = achromatic gray, 100% = fully vivid), and lightness (0% = black, 100% = white). Adjusting lightness or saturation in HSL produces more predictable results than the equivalent RGB operation, which is why most design tools expose HSL — or the close variant HSV/HSB, which substitutes "brightness/value" for lightness — as their primary color-picker model. HSL and RGB are two coordinate systems for the same sRGB color space; they describe exactly the same set of possible screen colors.

## Color schemes

The color wheel (traceable to Newton, formalized further by Chevreul in the 19th century) is the basis for a small set of named palette strategies:

- **Complementary** — colors opposite each other on the wheel (red–green, blue–orange, yellow–violet), which cancel each other's hue when mixed and produce strong visual contrast and tension when placed side by side. This is the mechanism behind [[clear-first-reads]]'s advice to use "high contrast against the background — complementary colors, or simply black text on white" for a page's dominant element.
- **Analogous** — colors next to each other on the wheel, producing a single-hued, monochromatic feel rather than contrast.
- **Split-complementary** — a complementary pair where, instead of the exact opposite color, a spread of hues analogous to it is used instead — a softer variant of the complementary scheme's contrast.
- **Triadic** — any three colors spaced roughly equidistant around the wheel.

## Color contrast

Chevreul formalized three kinds of contrast effect: **simultaneous** (two colors viewed side by side alter each other's apparent hue — a gray patch on a blue background looks tinted orange, blue's complement), **successive** (an afterimage left on a neutral background after looking away from a color), and **mixed** (an afterimage cast onto a *different* color rather than a neutral one). This is a perceptual effect on top of, and distinct from, the measured luminance-contrast ratios [[wcag|WCAG]] sets numeric minimums for — a page can satisfy a contrast-ratio requirement and still have colors that visually shift each other's appearance when placed adjacent.

## Warm vs. cool

Red-through-yellow hues are conventionally "warm" (associated with daylight and sunset, said to feel active or advancing); blue-green-through-violet hues are "cool" (associated with overcast skies, said to feel calm or receding). The article is careful to note that to the extent these effects are real, they're largely explained by warm pigments typically being more saturated and lighter in value than cool ones — i.e., it may be a saturation/value effect riding along with hue, not hue itself doing the work.

## The limits of "color harmony"

A practical caution worth taking seriously before treating any color-combination rule as a formula: human response to color combines individual factors (age, personality, mood), cultural/learned associations, the surrounding context (including ambient lighting), and even short-term trends — and since people can distinguish around 2.3 million colors, the space of possible combinations is effectively infinite. The article's conclusion is blunt: **predictive color-harmony formulae are fundamentally unsound** as universal rules, despite many theorists having proposed them. Color-wheel schemes (above) are a reasonable starting point for generating options, not a guarantee that a given combination will read as "harmonious" to everyone who sees it.

## Web color standards and historical constraints

**sRGB** is the baseline color space for the web — when a color is specified in HTML or CSS without a declared color space, it is interpreted as sRGB. sRGB defines the *gamut* (the range of reproducible colors) calibrated for consumer displays in the late 1990s, and contrast ratios (see [[wcag]]) are calculated against it. This is worth knowing when sourcing assets from design tools that default to a wider working space, since colors may look more vivid in the tool than they do in a browser rendering in sRGB.

**Web-safe colors (historical)**: In the mid-1990s, most monitors could display only 256 colors simultaneously; colors outside the system palette were *dithered* — approximated by a pattern of two nearby palette colors — producing a speckled texture instead of a solid fill. Designers of the era worked within a 216-color "web-safe" palette built from six equally-spaced hex values (00, 33, 66, 99, CC, FF) per RGB channel (6³ = 216). Even this was an overcount: on 16-bit displays, only about 22 of those 216 colors rendered without dithering. The constraint became obsolete with 24-bit TrueColor displays in the early 2000s and has no practical relevance to contemporary design. Its main legacy is as an explanation for why early web design looked so visually limited.

## Color consistency in interface design

Color signals meaning only through consistent use. When a given color reliably marks the same thing throughout an interface — interactive elements, destructive actions, a brand accent, a status state — users learn the association and navigate by it. Using the same hue for two different purposes in the same interface (e.g., a brand color applied to both interactive buttons and decorative non-interactive text) dissolves that learned signal, raising cognitive effort and increasing the chance of error. This is a direct application of the consistency principle in [[interface-design-principles]]: once a color carries a semantic role in an interface, that role should be held stable across the whole product. The flip side: introducing a color for a new semantic role (e.g., red for destructive actions) only works if that color is visually distinct from every other color already in use — otherwise it reads as decoration rather than signal.

## Color symbolism is culture-bound, not universal

The same caution applies even more sharply to color *meaning*. Red alone has been used to connote excitement, danger, luck, romance, and femininity — depending entirely on culture and context, not on anything intrinsic to the color. Color associations are learned, not fixed, and don't transfer reliably across cultures, contexts, or individuals; claims that color has measurable therapeutic effects have no real evidential support. This sharpens [[accessibility]]'s existing "never rely on color alone to carry meaning" guidance with a second, independent reason beyond color vision deficiency: even customers who can see a color perfectly well may not read the *meaning* a designer intended into it, because that meaning was never universal in the first place. The safer pattern, already established in this wiki, is to pair color with text, icons, or position rather than letting a hue alone carry a message.
