# Gestalt Psychology

An early-20th-century school of perceptual psychology, founded by Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler, and Kurt Koffka (Wertheimer's 1912 paper on the phi phenomenon marks its formal start), built around one central claim: people perceive organized wholes before they perceive the individual parts that make them up — "the whole is something else than the sum of its parts." Several patterns already in this wiki rely on specific Gestalt principles without naming them; this page makes that shared foundation explicit.

## The principles of perceptual organization

- **Proximity** — elements placed close together are perceived as a single group, independent of what they actually are. [[grid-layout]]'s instruction to "group related elements visually... while keeping unrelated elements apart" is a direct application.
- **Similarity** — elements that share visual traits (shape, color, size) are perceived as related, even when they're physically apart. [[grid-layout]]'s "shared size/color/font" grouping technique applies this alongside proximity.
- **Closure** — people mentally complete a shape with visual gaps in it, rather than perceiving the gaps as missing information; the classic example is a logo (the article cites IBM's) read as a complete word or mark despite literal gaps in its strokes.
- **Continuity** — elements arranged along a smooth line or curve are perceived as belonging together, continuing in the direction already established, rather than as separate fragments.
- **Common fate** — elements that move together (or appear to) are perceived as one group, even if they look nothing alike — the visual-design analog of "things that move together belong together."
- **Symmetry** — symmetric elements are perceived as a single coherent unit organized around a center, rather than as independent halves.
- **Figure–ground organization** — perception splits a scene into a prominent **figure** and a receding **background**, never both at once. [[clear-first-reads]]'s "first read" — the one dominant element a visitor's eye lands on, with everything else receding behind it — is figure-ground organization applied to a Web page, which is also the source of that pattern's informal use of the word "gestalt" for the page's overall first impression.
- **Law of past experience** — ambiguous visual stimuli get categorized according to what a person has already seen before, not from the stimulus alone — the perceptual basis for why [[grid-layout]]'s placement-expectation research (where customers expect a shopping cart or sign-in link to be) works at all.

## Design applications

The source article names interface design directly (radio-button placement), alongside cartography and desktop layout design as fields where these principles get applied deliberately. In this wiki's terms: nearly every existing layout pattern that talks about "grouping," "consistent placement," or a page's "focal point" is leaning on one or more of these principles already, whether or not the source material for that pattern named Gestalt psychology explicitly.

## Limitations

The theory is criticized as more descriptive than explanatory: it names reliable perceptual effects without a precise, agreed mechanism for *why* the visual system organizes information this way, and critics note the laws can sound vague when stated loosely ("things that go together, go together"). For design purposes this isn't disqualifying — the principles are well-replicated descriptions of what people actually perceive, which is what a layout pattern needs, even without a settled account of the underlying neuroscience.

## Notes for the wiki

## Further reading

Victor Ponamariov's *50 Tips to Improve User Interface* (self-published ebook, no stated license — not ingested into this wiki; see `raw/copyrighted/50_ui_tips.pdf`) applies the proximity principle to form layout (labels closer to their own input than to adjacent ones; headlines closer to their body copy than to the element above), and cites Miller's Law (working memory holds ~7±2 objects) as the rationale for grouping related form fields with clear whitespace between clusters.

## Notes for the wiki

A local snapshot is saved at `raw/safe/wikipedia-gestalt-psychology.html` alongside the live URL. Licensed CC BY-SA 4.0, same treatment as this wiki's other Wikipedia sources — content folded in is paraphrased, not quoted.

**What was left out, and why** (per `schema.md`'s ingestion-report requirement): the article's history of the broader Gestalt school beyond perceptual organization (its influence on social psychology, its institutional history in Germany and the Nazi-era emigration of its founders to the U.S.) was left out as outside `purpose.md`'s UI/UX scope — kept only the perceptual-organization principles and their design applications. The cartography/map example (the Mississippi River map) was summarized only in passing rather than detailed, since [[grid-layout]] and [[clear-first-reads]] already supply this wiki's own Web-design examples for the same principles.

Linked this page from [[grid-layout]] (proximity/similarity, already described without being named) and [[clear-first-reads]] (figure-ground, including clarifying that page's informal pre-existing use of the word "gestalt"). Did not force a connection to `above-the-fold` or `consistent-sidebars-of-related-content` — both are adjacent layout patterns but don't have a specific Gestalt-principle claim strong enough to cite without it feeling tacked on.
