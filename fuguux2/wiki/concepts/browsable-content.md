# Browsable Content

**Problem:** browsing only works if content is organized in a way that matches how customers think about it, and if there are clear, consistent cues for where they are and how to get back — without both, browsing becomes either confusing or a dead end.

**Background:** one of the two intention-driven styles in [[multiple-ways-to-navigate]] (alongside search), for customers who don't yet have a precise enough goal to search for, or who simply prefer following links. Libraries (organized for searching, via the Dewey decimal or Library of Congress system) and bookstores (organized for browsing, by genre/topic/author within loosely related sections) solve a related problem differently because their patrons have different needs — the same is true for content on the Web.

**Solution:**

- **Pick an organizational scheme** that fits the content and the audience — see [[content-organization-schemes]] for the five named schemes (hierarchical, task-based, alphabetical, chronological, popularity-based) and when each one fits.
- **Structure content with customers in mind, not your own internal vocabulary.** Use [[card-sorting]] to discover how customers naturally group items and what they call the groups, ideally with several people so disagreement can flag ambiguous terms.
- **Provide strong information scent.** **Information scent** (a term coined by researchers at Xerox PARC) is the perceived proximity to the information a customer wants, built from cues like link/category text, images, headings, grouping, page layout, and what they've already seen. A label like "Movies" has good scent for someone looking for a DVD; a label like "Computers" has poor scent for someone looking for a digital music player, even though that's arguably where it belongs. Redundant cues — listing the same item under more than one category — improve the odds a customer finds it regardless of which label they expect.
- **Help customers find their way back.** Tab rows or breadcrumb trails let someone explore without fear of getting lost, and a clickable logo that always returns to the homepage is a near-universal expectation.
- **Avoid information overload.** A clear [[grid-layout]], a strong visual hierarchy, consistent content/navigation areas, and a readable font let customers scan a page rather than having to read it end to end to find what they need.

**Forces:** organizing for browsing and organizing for searching aren't the same problem — a scheme that makes perfect sense to someone who already knows the destination (searching) can still leave a browsing customer lost if the category labels don't carry information scent on their own.

This information-scent requirement carries through wherever browsing leads: into [[category-pages]] once a customer reaches a section, and onto the [[homepage-portal|homepage]] itself, where it's one of the things that makes navigation feel predictable.

Victor Ponamariov's *50 Tips to Improve User Interface* (self-published ebook, no stated license — not ingested into this wiki; see `raw/copyrighted/50_ui_tips.pdf`) contributes several navigation clarity tips relevant here, including showing a partially-visible item at the edge of a scrollable list to signal scrollability, always providing a visible next step at potential dead ends (error pages, empty states, end-of-flow screens), and frequency-first ordering for navigation menus.
