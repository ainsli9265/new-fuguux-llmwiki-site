# Homepage Portal

**Problem:** the homepage is a Web site's most-visited page by a wide margin (seen ten to over a thousand times more than any other page) and must seduce a diverse mix of first-time and returning visitors while simultaneously balancing branding, navigation, content, personalization, and download speed — all within the limited space [[above-the-fold]].

**Solution:** treat the homepage as a single page that has to do several things at once, and design deliberately for each:

- **Build site identity and brand** — state the [[up-front-value-proposition]] and reinforce it with site branding and a visible privacy policy, then actually fulfill that promise on every subsequent page.
- **Get the look and feel right for the target audience** — a style mismatched to the audience (e.g. loud, youth-oriented graphics on a serious or conservative site) creates instant doubt that the visitor is in the right place; tune it by repeatedly testing with a dozen-plus members of the intended audience.
- **Seduce with content** — customers judge a site within seconds, so lead with a catchy headline/blurb or a [[clear-first-reads|clear first read]], and consider a content-management/publishing system so content modules can rotate without manual upkeep.
- **Personalize if it's worth the cost** — **personalization** (the site adapts content based on data it infers or already holds, e.g. past purchases or browsing history) and **customization** (the customer explicitly chooses or configures what they see) are related but distinct; either feels faster and more relevant than a one-size-fits-all homepage, but both need more infrastructure (logins, cookies, server/database resources) and only pay off if there's enough varied content to personalize or customize. Doing either well also requires fair information practices and a clear privacy policy, since customers need to [[trust-and-credibility|trust the site]] enough to hand over the data it runs on.
- **Balance brand space against navigation space** — site branding (top-left) is typically the [[clear-first-reads|first read]] and the value proposition the second, so both need to be unmistakably clear rather than simply bigger; customers skim for recognizable phrases, so invest in wording (descriptive, longer link names) over decoration; and since a "primary audience" is really several subgroups with different questions, dedicate roughly 95% of above-the-fold space/links to the dominant 95% of visitors and the remaining 5% to everyone else (often via a role-selection subsidiary page) — a practical instance of the same progressive-disclosure logic [[hicks-law]] gives a formal basis for: fewer visible choices at once means a faster decision for the visitors who see them.
- **Make navigation predictable** — customers need to instantly recognize what's clickable and trust that clicking produces a predictable result; support this with [[multiple-ways-to-navigate]] and strong information scent (see [[browsable-content]] for what that term means and how to build it).

**Forces:** branding, navigation, content, and performance all compete for the same limited above-the-fold space, and personalization in particular trades relevance for added complexity, infrastructure cost, and a trust burden.

A cohesive page layout ([[grid-layout]], [[page-template|page templates]], [[clear-first-reads|clear first reads]]) and fast downloads matter as much as the content itself — homepage images are guaranteed to be uncached on a first visit, so leaning on HTML text, compressed/cropped images, and avoiding splash screens, sounds, and applets on the homepage specifically keeps load time within the few seconds visitors will tolerate before bouncing to a competitor. When a homepage genuinely can't be made fast enough, [[interface-design-principles]]'s feedback principle covers how to keep that wait from feeling worse than it is. This pattern, [[up-front-value-proposition]], and the rest of the patterns it leans on (navigation bars, [[browsable-content]], [[search-action-module]], [[consistent-sidebars-of-related-content|sidebars]], style sheets) illustrate the "pattern language" idea from [[web-design-patterns]]: no single pattern stands alone. It's also the pattern [[web-site-development-process]]'s Exploration phase draws on directly when shaping the homepage's structure.
