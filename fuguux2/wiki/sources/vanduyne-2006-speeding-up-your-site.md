# Speeding Up Your Site

Pattern Group L of *The Design of Sites* — six patterns (L1-L6) for making a site download, and feel, fast: LOW NUMBER OF FILES, FAST-LOADING IMAGES, SEPARATE TABLES, HTML POWER, REUSABLE IMAGES, and FAST-LOADING CONTENT.

## Key points

- L1-L5 are almost entirely implementation technique: removing unnecessary files, image file-format trade-offs (GIF vs. JPEG vs. PNG, cropping/shrinking/compression ratios, progressive-scan vs. interlaced loading), splitting large HTML tables so the top of a page renders before the rest, using native HTML markup instead of images, and relying on browser image caching. Per `purpose.md`'s "specific code implementation" exclusion, none of this was extracted into wiki pages — it sits below the UX/design-principle level this wiki tracks, regardless of how many sources might eventually repeat it.
- L6 (FAST-LOADING CONTENT) is the one pattern in this group with real UX substance: the distinction between actual speed and *perceived* speed, and a taxonomy of progress indicators — a static text message, an animated "marching ants" indicator, a thermometer, and progressively displaying content as it arrives — each with a real trade-off (a thermometer is the most reassuring when accurate, but worse than no indicator at all when it isn't). This is a direct, concrete elaboration of the "offer informative feedback" principle already documented in [[interface-design-principles]], so it was folded into that page's existing feedback principle rather than split into a new one.
- [[homepage-portal]] already noted that "fast downloads matter as much as content" — added a forward link there to [[interface-design-principles]]'s feedback principle, for the case where a homepage genuinely can't be made fast enough and the next-best thing is managing the wait itself.
